# UFC Stats
## Calculate the win rate of UFC fighters using Fighting Tomatoes API
### How to use:
1. Go to https://fightingtomatoes.com/API to get your personal API key;
2. Replace the `ufc_api_key` in line *#5* with your own;
3. Launch the script;
4. Enter the first and last name of the fighter;
5. The script will calculate the win rate of the fighter.
### Notes:
This is an example project of using https://fightingtomatoes.com APIs. For stats other than wins take a look at the `json_data` variable.

The idea for this project was suggested by: https://youtu.be/txKBWtvV99Y
